1) I don't know how to program, 2) I don't know how to use GitHub      Please be patient.
2) I wasn't kidding when I said I don't know how to program or use github.  Just a smattering of dos, bash, pshell, lots of forgotten ones.  Autohotkey is what I'm best at and that's not much.
3) This is some beginner level documentation for the Automa Chrome Plugin, which I discovered about a week ago (12/1/2021) and may be just the thing for an RPA (robotic process automation) project I'm working on.
4) I wasn't having much luck with how the variables and data is stored (I don't know javascript or .json), but I realized I could store the information on the web page, and it would be a great tool for beginners.

<b> If you are brand new to Automa scroll down to Start at the main branch, this is Lesson Two</b>

(12/14/21) I just managed to delete most of this page, they say you can find it if you look through the changes
