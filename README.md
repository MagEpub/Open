1) I don't know how to program, 2) I don't know how to use GitHub  Please be patient.
2) I wasn't kidding when I said I don't know how to program or use github.  Just a smattering of dos, bash, pshell, lots of forgotten ones.  Autohotkey is what I'm best at and that's not much.
3) This is some beginner level documentation for the Automa Chrome Plugin, which I discovered about a week ago and may be just the thing for an RPA (robotic process automation) project I'm working on.
4) I wasn't having much luck with how the variables and data is stored (I don't know javascript or .json), but I realized I could store the information on the web page, and it would be a great tool for beginners.

Before starting:  Install Automa from the Chrome web store, and make sure file access is enabled

How it works
a) Create a simple html web page with input boxes
b) open it in chrome with file:///
c) The element selectors are always the same, making learning easier.
e) The script opens the page and writes the word "one" in the input box

There are three files

AFS New Tab Write.json = the script.  Import it into Automa (scripts are called workflows)

AFS New Tab Write.txt = all the settings for the blocks.  For now I'm storing this in a global variable in the workflow

testpage.htm = the page to practice on.

I plan to publish the actual sequence of steps soon.

Thank you to https://github.com/Kholid060 who created Automa
